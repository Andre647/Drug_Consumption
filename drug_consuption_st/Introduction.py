st.markdown("# Introduction") 
"Excessive drug use is a public health problem that affects millions of people worldwide. According to the 2021 World Drug Report by the UN, around 275 million people used drugs at least once in the previous year, and about 36 million suffered from drug use disorders. Effective prevention and treatment programs can significantly reduce the negative impacts of drug abuse. Data shows that every dollar invested in dependency treatment can result in a savings of up to 7 dollars in crime-related and judicial costs. Furthermore, treatment and rehabilitation can improve individuals' quality of life and facilitate their reintegration into society."

st.markdown("# Objective") 
"My goal with this notebook is to interpret the use of drugs by the global population and to explore any relationship between substance use and the individual's psyche. Additionally, a study and classification model will be conducted to determine whether a given individual is prone to using certain substances. The idea is that this mini-project will serve as a foundation for anyone wishing to conduct future analyses for the prevention and treatment of people in this situation, a problem that persists in my home country, Brazil."
